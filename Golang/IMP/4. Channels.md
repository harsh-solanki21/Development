# Go Channels

- Channels provide a way to send data from one goroutine to another, ensuring smooth communication and synchronization in concurrent programs.
- Channels are an integral part of Go’s approach to concurrency, providing a safe and efficient way to exchange data between concurrent tasks.

**Simple Example**

```go
func sendData(ch chan<- int) {
    // send data to the channel
    ch <- 20
}

func main() {
    // create a channel
    ch := make(chan int)

    // start a goroutine to send data to the channel
    go sendData(ch)

    // receive data from the channel
    value := <- ch
    fmt.Println("Received: ", value)
}

// Output: 1
```

## Types of Channels

#### 1. Unbuffered Channels

- Unbuffered channels are created without specifying a buffer size.
- The key feature of unbuffered channels is their synchronous nature: **both sending and receiving operations block until the other side is ready.**
- This creates a direct, synchronous communication between the sender and the receiver.

**Unbuffered Example**

```go
func main() {
    // create an unbuffered channel
    ch := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Sending value 1 to channel")
        ch <- 1
        fmt.Println("After sending value 1")
    }()

    // sleep for 3 seconds to ensure the goroutine has time to send the value
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

    fmt.Println("Receiving value from channel")
    val := <-ch
    fmt.Println(val)

    // sleep 1 second to ensure goroutine has time to finish goroutine
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

/*
Output:
Sending value 1 to channel
(... waits for 3 seconds ...)
Receiving value from channel
1
After sending value 1
*/
```

<br />

#### 2. Buffered Channels

- Buffered channels are created by specifying a buffer size.
- The key feature of buffered channels is their asynchronous nature: **sending and receiving operations are not blocking until the buffer is full or empty.**
- However, when the buffer is full, the sending operation is blocked until the receiver makes some space in the buffer by receiving data. Same as when the buffer is empty, the receiving operation is blocked until the sender fills some data into the buffer.
- It's important to note that messages are received in the same order they were sent (FIFO - First In, First Out).

**Buffered Example 1:**

```go
func main() {
    // Unbuffered channel
    unbufferedCh := make(chan int)

    // Buffered channel
    bufferedCh := make(chan string, 2)

    go func() {
        unbufferedCh <- 20
    }()

    go func() {
        bufferedCh <- "Hello"
        bufferedCh <- "World"
        close(bufferedCh)
    }()

    value := <- unbufferedCh
    fmt.Println("Received from unbuffered channel: ", value)

    fmt.Println("Received from buffered channel: ")
    for msg := range bufferedCh {
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }
}
```

<br />

**Buffered Example 2:**

```go
func main() {
    // create a buffered channel with capacity 2
    ch := make(chan int, 2)

    // start timing to calculate the time elapsed
    start := time.Now()

    go sender(ch, start)
    go receiver(ch, start)

    // delay for two goroutines to complete
    time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)
}

func sender(ch chan<- int, start time.Time) {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        fmt.Printf("Sending %d at %s\n", i, time.Since(start))
        ch <- i
        fmt.Printf("Sent %d at %s\n", i, time.Since(start))
    }
}

func receiver(ch <-chan int, start time.Time) {
    // delay start to demonstrate buffer filling up
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        val := <-ch
        fmt.Printf("Received %d at %s\n", val, time.Since(start))

        // sleep to simulate slow receiver
        time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

/*
Output:
Sending 1 at 9.958µs
Sent 1 at 266.166µs
Sending 2 at 285.833µs

## Direction Channel

- In the above example, as their name suggest, `sender` sends data to the channel, while `receiver` receives data from it. This scenario introduces us to the concept of directional channels in Go.

- Directional channels are channels that are restricted to either sending or receiving operations. Go allows us to specify the direction of a channel, making it either send-only or receive-only. This feature enhances `type safety` and clarifies the `intended use` of a channel within a function.

<br />

We can specify the direction of a channel using the following syntax:

- `chan<-` for a **send-only** channel
- `<-chan` for a **receive-only** channel

Just like the last example, we specify the direction at the function signature.

```go
func sender(ch chan<- int, start time.Time) {}
func receiver(ch <-chan int, start time.Time) {}
```

<br />

## Close Channel

- We can close a channel using the `close` function. **The primary purpose of closing a channel is to notify receivers that no more data will be sent, allowing them to stop waiting for additional data.**

For senders, attempting to send data on a closed channel will cause a panic:

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    close(ch)

    fmt.Println("Attempting to send to a closed channel...")
    ch <- 1
}

/*
Output:
Attempting to send to a closed channel...
panic: send on closed channel
*/
```

<br />

For receivers, reading from a closed channel immediately returns the zero value of the channel's type without blocking. We can use the "comma ok" idiom to check whether a channel is closed:

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    close(ch)

    fmt.Println("Reading from a closed channel:")
    value, ok := <-ch
    fmt.Printf("Value: %v, Channel open: %v\n", value, ok)
}

/*
Output:
Reading from a closed channel:
Value: 0, Channel open: false
*/
```

**The ", ok" is crucial because it's the only way to distinguish between receiving a zero value from an open channel and receiving from a closed channel.**

- From the above example, we can see that the sender can't send data to a closed channel, but the receiver can still receive data from a closed channel. Therefore, it's important to note that the responsibility of closing a channel lies with the sender, not the receiver. In Go concurrency patterns, it's common to see the function have following patterns:

1. Create a channel
2. Start a goroutine to send data to the channel
   - Inside the goroutine, close the channel after sending all data
3. Return the channel as receive-only channel to the caller

**Here's a simple example of this pattern:**

```go
func foo() <-chan int {
  // create a channel
  ch := make(chan int)

  // start a goroutine to send data to the channel
  go func() {
    // close the channel after sending all data
    defer close(ch)

    // send data to the channel
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
      ch <- i
    }
  }()

  // return the channel
  return ch
}
```

This pattern, though simple, is widely used in the Go concurrency patterns. The key takeaway is that this function creates a channel, and sends data to the channel, so it's responsible for closing the channel.

In Go concurrency patterns, it's common to see receivers continuously reading from a channel until it's closed. Here's an example:

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go sender(ch)
    go receiver(ch)

    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}

func sender(ch chan<- int) {
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
}

func receiver(ch <-chan int) {
    // keep receiving data from the channel in an infinite loop
    for {
        value, ok := <-ch

        // if the channel is closed, break the loop
        if !ok {
            fmt.Println("Channel closed")
            break
        }

        fmt.Printf("Received value: %v\n", value)
    }
}
```

In this example, the sender sends two values to the channel and then closes the channel. The receiver keeps receiving data from the channel in a infinite loop until the channel is closed.

However, Go provides a more idiomatic way to achieve this using the range keyword:

```go
func receiver(ch <-chan int) {
    for value := range ch {
        fmt.Printf("Received value: %v\n", value)
    }
}
```

When using range, the loop automatically breaks when the channel is closed, making the code more concise and readable.

When using range to receive data from the channel, always remember to close the channel if the receiver continuously receiving data, otherwise, the program will deadlock.

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
            ch <- i
        }
        // oops, forgot to close the channel after sending all data
    }()

    // keep receiving data from the channel
    for v := range ch {
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
}

/*
Output:
0
1
2
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
*/
```

In this example, after sending three values, the goroutine exits without closing the channel. The main goroutine continues waiting for more data, resulting in a deadlock. Go's runtime is smart enough to detect that no other goroutine can send data to the channel, leading to this error.
