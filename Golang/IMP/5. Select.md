## Select

- The Select statement is used to handle multiple channels in a non-blocking manner. It provides a way to wait on multiple communication operations simultaneously and executes the first case that is ready.

**Example:**

```go
func main() {
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "one"
	}()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "two"
	}()

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-c1:
			fmt.Println("received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-c2:
			fmt.Println("received", msg2)
		}
	}
}
```
