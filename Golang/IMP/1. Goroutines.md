## Goroutines

- Goroutines is a lightweight, independently running function that allows concurrent execution in a program. It's like a mini-thread managed by the Go runtime, making it easy to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Goroutines are a key feature for concurrent programming in the Go language.

```go
func sendMsg(msg string) {
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)) * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println(msg)
}

func main() {
	sendMsg("hello") // sync

	go sendMsg("test1") // async
	go sendMsg("test2") // async
	go sendMsg("test3") // async

	sendMsg("main") // sync

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
```

- When the sendMsg function is called with the go keyword, the main function will not wait for the sendMsg function to finish executing before it continues to the next line of code and will return immediately after the sendMsg function is called.

- Otherwise, the function is called synchronously, and the main function will wait for the sendMsg function to finish executing before it continues to the next line of code.
