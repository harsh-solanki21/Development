## Wait Groups

- WaitGroups are used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
- It allows you to synchronize the main goroutine with a group of worker goroutines.

**Example:**

```go

func printMessage(wg *sync.WaitGroup, msg string) {
    defer wg.Done()  // Decrement the WaitGroup counter when the goroutine completes
    fmt.Println(msg)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(3) // Set the number of goroutines to wait for

    go printMessage(&wg, "Hello")
    go printMessage(&wg, "Go")
    go printMessage(&wg, "Wait Group")

    wg.Wait() // Wait for all goroutines to finish
    fmt.Println("All goroutines have finished.")
}
```
