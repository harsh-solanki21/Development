## Mutex

- Mutex is a synchronization mechanism that allows only one goroutine to access a shared resource at a time. It's like a lock that ensures that only one goroutine can modify the shared resource at a time.

**Example:**

```go
func worker(wg *sync.WaitGroup, mutex *sync.Mutex, counter *int) {
    mutex.Lock()
    *counter++
    mutex.Unlock()
    wg.Done()
}

func main() {
    var w sync.WaitGroup
    var m sync.Mutex
    counter := 0

    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        w.Add(1)
        go worker(&w, &m, &counter)
    }

    w.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Value of x", counter)
}
```
