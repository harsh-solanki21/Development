# Conventional Commits

## Commit Types

### API relevant changes:

- **feat**: Commits that add or remove a new feature
- **fix**: Commits that fix a bug

### Other commit types:

- **refactor**: Commits that rewrite/restructure code, however do not change any API behaviour
- **perf**: Special refactor commits that improve performance
- **style**: Commits that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Commits that add missing tests or correct existing tests
- **docs**: Commits that affect documentation only
- **build**: Commits that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version
- **ops**: Commits that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery
- **chore**: Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying .gitignore

## Examples:

- `feat: add email notifications on new direct messages`
- `feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button`
- `fix(api): handle empty message in request body`
